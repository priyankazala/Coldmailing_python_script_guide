# Email Outreach Automation for Job Opportunities

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of sending personalized emails for job application outreach. It reads recipient details from an Excel file, composes personalized email messages, attaches resumes, and sends emails using SMTP.

## Features

- **Email Personalization**: Each email is personalized with recipient name and company name.
- **Attachment Support**: Resumes can be attached to each email.
- **Excel Integration**: Recipient details are read from an Excel file, making it easy to manage and update recipient information.
- **Security**: Sensitive information like email credentials and personal details should be securely stored using environment variables or a configuration file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/priyankazala/Coldmailing_python_script_guide

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Coldmailing_python_script_guide
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Prepare your Excel file with recipient details. The Excel file should contain columns for email address, recipient name, and company name.

5. Update the script (`email_outreach.py`) with your email credentials and attachment details:

   - Replace `'username@gmail.com'` with your email address.
   - Replace `'your_password'` with your email password.
   - Update the `attachment_path` and `attachment_filename` variables with the path and filename of your resume file.

6. Run the script:

   ```
   python code.py
   ```

7. Monitor the console output for status updates and error messages.

## Customization

- Modify the email template and message body in the `send_email` function to suit your requirements.
- Customize error handling and logging as needed for your workflow.

## Security Considerations

- Avoid sharing sensitive information like email credentials and personal details in public repositories. Use environment variables or a configuration file for secure storage.
- Ensure compliance with email regulations and anti-spam laws when sending bulk emails.
